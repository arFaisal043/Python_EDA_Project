# Telco Customer Churn Analysis Using Python - EDA Project

## 📊 Project Overview

A data analytics project to identify key factors that cause customer churn and provide actionable business insights to reduce churn rate.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges for subscription-based businesses. Losing customers directly impacts revenue and growth. The company wants to understand **why customers are leaving?** and **what actions can reduce churn?**.

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Overall Churn Rate**: 26.54% of customers churned
- **High-Risk Groups**: 
  - Senior citizens churn at 41.7% (2x higher than non-seniors)
  - Month-to-month contracts have 42.71% churn rate (15x higher than 2-year contracts)
- **Strong Predictors**: Contract type, customer tenure, and age
- **Not Significant**: Gender shows minimal correlation with churn

---

## 📊 Dataset Information

- **Source:** Kaggle (Telecom Customer Churn Dataset)
- **Records:** 7,000+ customers

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data cleaning & manipulation  
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization  

---

## 🔍 Methodology / Workflow

1. Data Loading & Inspection  
2. Data Cleaning (missing values, data types)  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Visualization of churn patterns  
5. Insight extraction & recommendations  

---

## 📊 Key Visualizations

1. **Churn Distribution** - Overall churn rate
2. **Senior Citizen Analysis** - 2x higher churn rate
3. **Contract Type Impact** - Month-to-month vs. long-term
4. **Tenure Relationship** - New customers churn more

---

## 🧠 Business Recommendations

- **Priority**: Focus retention efforts on senior citizens
- **Strategy**: Convert month-to-month to annual contracts
- **Timing**: Target new customers early in lifecycle

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- **Exploratory analysis only (no predictive modeling)**
- **Dataset-specific insights**

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- **Build a churn prediction model**
- **Deploy interactive dashboard using Power BI or Streamlit**
- **Perform feature engineering for better insights**
